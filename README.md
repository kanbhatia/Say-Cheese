The goal of this project was to live Identify usersâ€™ gender from front camera using a CNN. The CNN model was trained using 150,000 pictures of males and females to achieve an accuracy of 98% and ~0.1 loss. First the pictures were converted to arrays using OpenCV. 

You can find the code here ('Model/convo1.ipynb')

Google Colab was used to train the model. Three dense layers were used along with 100 epochs.
